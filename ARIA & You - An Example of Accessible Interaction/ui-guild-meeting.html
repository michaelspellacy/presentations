				<h1>ARIA & You: An Example of Accessible Interaction</h1>

				<p>Posted on <b>March 21st, 2017</b> by <b>Michael Spellacy</b></p>

				<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)</a> is an extension of HTML, created by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>, that allows authors to make their websites or appications more usable to various assistive technologies (AT), such as screen or braille readers.</p>

				<p>Today we will review the navigation for Kaiser Permanent's career site and discuss the some of the finer points of including ARIA in our work.<p>

				<p>In the process of creating our navigation, we adhere to the core principles of progressive enhancment and <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/">resilient design</a>, and that is in crafting an experience that is always usable at it's core, while enahncing it for more capable technology. As always, we begin with good old HTML.</p>

				<h3>Semantics</h3>

				<p>For the markup of our navigation, we focus on providing semantic robustness:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Use of HTML5 landmarks, such as <code>&lt;navigation&gt;</code>, provide additional baked in information to AT users, so be sure to use them where appropriate.</li>
					<li>While sighted users are instantly provided with context when looking at the screen, AT users may require additional aids to assist them in using your interface. For example, we could create a heading and then hide it offscreen, but ARIA can provide the same information about your interface, through use of the <code>aria-label</code> attribute. On our navigation we have added such a label and have given it a value of "primary".</li>
					<li>ID's on our <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements will provide a nice hook in helping us  additional context and enhancment for sighted and non-sighted users alike.</li>
				</ol>

<pre><code contenteditable="true">&lt;<strong>nav</strong> id="primary-nav" <strong>aria-label="primary"</strong>&gt;

    &lt;ul id="primary-nav-list"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;

        <strong>&lt;h2 class="primary-nav-heading"&gt;Who We Are&lt;/h2&gt;</strong>

        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li <strong>id="nav-the-kp-difference"</strong>&gt;&lt;a href="/the-kp-difference/"&gt;The KP Difference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 
            &lt;li id="nav-location"&gt;&lt;a href="/locations/"&gt;Our Locations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li id="nav-mission-and-history"&gt;&lt;a href="/mission-and-history/"&gt;Mission &amp; History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li id="nav-innovation"&gt;&lt;a href="/innovation/"&gt;Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;

    ...

    &lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/<strong>nav</strong>&gt;</code></pre>


				<h3>Enhance</h3>

				<p>Since we will be using JavaScript to enhance our navigation, we need to ensure that we are providing <em>parity</em> for AT users. It is not enough to create an interface that can be toggled visually. There is deeper work to be done here to provide a navigational system that can be used by all people.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>

						<p>First, we add our menu button. This button will toggle the navigation opened and closed. We could add the button directly to our markup as inline HTML, but since it only exists to toggle our navigation, via script, then it can be treated as an enhancement, via script, as well.</p>

						<p>Note the addition of aria-expanded to the button. Since our navigation is initially closed, we immediatly set this value to a default state of "false".</p>

						<pre><code contenteditable="true">&lt;button id="primary-button" <strong>aria-expanded="false</strong>"&gt;Menu&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>

						<p>Normally, we might place a menu button outside of the navigation landmark, but by placing it <em>within</em> the landmark, we are providing better context for AT users. Screen readers will now announce a varient of: "Menu, collapsed button navigation primary". This allows our button to dovetail nicely with the parent <code>aria-label</code> attribute that has a value of "primary". If this button were placed outside of our navigation, a screen reader might only announce: "Menu, collapsed button", which is not very helpful. In that case, we might require additional ARIA attributes, such as aria-labeledby, to auditorially bind the button and the navigation together, but why do that when simply inserting the button here is so much easier and elegant?</p>

					</li> 
					<li>

						<p>Next, we need to enhance our h2 element. It is no longer a heading, but an interactive element within our navigation.:</p>

		<pre><code contenteditable="true">&lt;h2 class="primary-nav-heading" <strong>aria-expanded="false"</strong> <strong>role="button"</strong> <strong>tabindex="0"</strong>&gt;Who We Are&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>

						<p>Here we must also include aria-expanded with an initial state of "false". We also append a role attribute with a value of "button", since it is now a button, and a tabindex with a value of "0". Setting an element with a tabindex of zero allows a non-focusable element to receive focus.</p>

					</li>
					<li>

						<p>Finally, we append a hidden element to the navigation:</p>

		<pre><code contenteditable="true">&lt;div <strong>hidden</strong> id="current-selection">Current Page&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

						<p>This element will work cosely with our ID's.</p>

					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Interaction</h3>

					<p>Business as usual in applying a script that toggles our navigation button and navigation sub menus, but in additon to these behaviors, we also need to ensure that we are applying equivelency to our ARIA attributes. ARIA states need to be toggled as well, to indicate to a screen reader that states within the menu have changed.</p>

					<p>A part of our script will also match the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> ID with the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> ID. When there is a match, our script will append aria-labeledby with a value of "current-selection", to the list items hyperlink:</p>

				<code><pre>&lt;a href="#content" aria-describedby="current-selection"&gt;The KP Difference&lt;/a&gt;</pre></code>

				<p>In addition to this, we will also change the matched links href value to instead anchor to a position within the page, rather than take us to the same page again after clicking on it. When a screen reader accesses the link, the following will be read aloud: "Internal, link, The KP Difference" or "Link, The KP Difference, Current Page". The aria-describedby value can also be used as a styling hook to indicate to visual users that the selection is for the current page as well. This enhancement is a really nice touch for visual and non-visual users alike!</p>

				<h3>Don't Forget</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Escape Key - Be mindul of keyboard navigation. This means providing additional scripting for events such as clicking on the escape key or space bar.</p>
					<li>Focus Management - What happens when a user closes your interface? Where does the elements focus go? Typically we return focus to the initiation point, so that a user can continue on with experience from there. So, closing the navigation with an escape key, might bring us back to the menu button, etc. </li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Takeaways</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Our interfaces go deeper than what we can see on our monitors. A great user interface can be used by anynody.
					<li>Parity between the visual and non-visual experience is integral to success.
					<li>Use the right elements for the job and use ARIA to aid the experience where needed. The first rule of ARIA is not to use it. For example, use &lt;button&gt;  instead of &lt;div role="button"&gt;</li>
					<li>Accessibility can be hard at first, but get's easier with practice. Take simple steps to improving. Estimate accordingly to allow for it.</li>
				</ul>
